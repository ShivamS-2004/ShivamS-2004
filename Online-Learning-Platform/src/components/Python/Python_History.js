        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4"><li>	Python laid its foundation in the late 1980s.</li>
          <li>	The implementation of Python was started in December 1989 by Guido Van Rossum at CWI in Netherland.</li>
          <li>	In February 1991, Guido Van Rossum published the code (labeled version 0.9.0) to alt sources.</li>
          <li>	In 1994, Python 1.0 was released with new features like lambda, map, filter, and reduce.</li>
          <li>	Python 2.0 added new features such as list comprehensions, garbage collection systems.</li>
          <li>	On December 3, 2008, Python 3.0 (also called "Py3K") was released. It was designed to rectify the fundamental flaw of the language.</li>
          <li>	ABC programming language is said to be the predecessor of Python language, which was capable of Exception Handling and interfacing with the Amoeba Operating System.</li>
          <li>	The following programming languages influence Python:
            <br />ABC language.
            <br />Modula 3
          </li>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Why the Name Python?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          There is a fact behind choosing the name Python. Guido van Rossum was reading the script of a popular BBC comedy series "Monty Python's Flying Circus". It was late on-air 1970s.
          Van Rossum wanted to select a name which unique, sort, and little-bit mysterious. So, he decided to select naming Python after the "Monty Python's Flying Circus" for their newly created programming language.
          Python is also versatile and widely used in every technical field, such as Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Web Development, Mobile Application, Desktop Application, Scientific Calculation, etc.
          Python programming language is being updated regularly with new features and supports. There are lots of update in Python versions, started from 1994 to current release.
          Current version of Python: Python3.11.0
