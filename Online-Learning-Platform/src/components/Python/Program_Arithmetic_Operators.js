        <p className="mb-4">
          Program_Arithmetic_Operatorss are containers for storing data values in . A Program_Arithmetic_Operators is declared with the <code>var</code>, <code>let</code>, or <code>const</code> keyword, followed by a Program_Arithmetic_Operators name. The value of the Program_Arithmetic_Operators can be assigned using the assignment operator (<code>=</code>).
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Declaring Program_Arithmetic_Operatorss in </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          In , Program_Arithmetic_Operatorss can be declared using the <code>var</code>, <code>let</code>, or <code>const</code> keyword. The <code>var</code> keyword was traditionally used to declare Program_Arithmetic_Operatorss, but <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> were introduced in ES6 and are now the preferred way to declare Program_Arithmetic_Operatorss.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <code>var</code> is function-scoped, meaning that a Program_Arithmetic_Operators declared with <code>var</code> is only accessible within the function in which it is declared, or globally if declared outside a function. <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> are block-scoped, meaning that a Program_Arithmetic_Operators declared with <code>let</code> or <code>const</code> is only accessible within the block in which it is declared.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Assigning values to Program_Arithmetic_Operatorss</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          In , values can be assigned to Program_Arithmetic_Operatorss using the assignment operator (<code>=</code>). For example:
        </p>
        <pre className="bg-gray-400 text-white p-3 rounded-lg mb-4 w-full overflow-auto">
          <code>var x = 10; // declares a Program_Arithmetic_Operators x and assigns the value 10</code>
        </pre>
        <p className="mb-4">
          You can also assign the value of one Program_Arithmetic_Operators to another Program_Arithmetic_Operators, like this:
        </p>
        <pre className="bg-gray-400 text-white p-3  rounded-lg mb-4 w-full overflow-auto">
          <code>var x = 10;<br/>var y = x; // assigns the value of x to y</code>
        </pre>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Naming Program_Arithmetic_Operatorss in </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Program_Arithmetic_Operators names in  can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs. They must begin with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign. Program_Arithmetic_Operators names are case-sensitive.
